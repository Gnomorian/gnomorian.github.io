      <p>I'm Wil, a self taught programmer. This is my website, you can read a bit more about me, take a look at some of my personal projects or contact me. Have a nice stay!</p>

    <div class="tile" id="about" style="display:none; text-align:left;">
        <p>I am William Cameron, I currently reside in Christchurch, New Zealand, but I was born in England. I am told I am conscientious, kind, loyal and always eager to help. I work full time at The Warehouse where I manage the Footwear Department. In the evenings I go to Computer Power Plus where I am doing an IT Degree.</p>
        <p>When I am not doing any of those I can be found gaming or programming. I tend to make software that will assist me at work like the <a href="https://stock.burntoast.nz">StockFinder</a> website I made that helps me keep track of the stock I have in storage that cant go out yet, as we don't have a system for tracking stock. I will also make mods for games that I play to add features I think that should be there, or just fun things like the <a href="https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/227664-wyem-wear-your-enemies-mod">WYEM Mod</a> for Minecraft.</p>
        <p>I like learning new things so I have tinkered with many projects in different languages such as c++, Java, PHP, GO, D to name a few. When I am doing a personal project I tend to constantly change the language or library I am using because I believe I can make it more user friendly, neater, faster and better in another language, or just because I am curious about how it works.</p>

      <div id="clippy" class="project">
		<h2>Clippy</h2>
		<img src="images/clippy.png">
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/information.svg">A desktop app to record all your clipboard copies so you can use them again when you overwrite it.</p>
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/keyboard.jpg">it is made with java</p>
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/GitHub-Mark.png">You can download it or see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Gnomorian/Clippy">GitHub</a></p>
		<h3>The Pros</h3>
		<p>The app has been very useful to me, it sits in the tray recording my clipboard entries, if I copied something a while ago and can't find it again, it will be sitting in clippy, I just have to right click it, and select the sting I want to set to my clipboard. you can also modify how much it remembers, by default it's the last 10 entries, but it has a settings menu so you  can adjust that to whatever you like.</p>
		<h3>The Cons</h3>
		<p>you can manually make it run at startup, but it has a checkbox to set it too run at startup that doesn't work at the moment as I have to account for all operating systems, which I haven't got round to doing yet.</p>

	  <div id="stockfinder" class="project">
		<h2>Stock Finder</h2>
		<img src="images/stockfinder.png">
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/information.svg">A website I can run on my phone to record where all my excess stock is at work for finding easily months later.</p>
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/keyboard.jpg">It is made with CodeIgniter, a PHP framework. and MySQL as a database.</p>
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/GitHub-Mark.png">you can see the working site <a href="https://stock.burntoast.nz">here</a>. or view the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Gnomorian/StockFinder">GitHub</a></p>
		<h3>The Pros</h3>
		<p>I was quite pleased with this project, I learnt a lot about MySQL and  User Authentication by making this. It is fully functional, it can record all the shoes I store at work, the forms presented to the user are dynamic based on the MySQL database incase I add new Categories of shoes or remove them. you can search for everything or apply a filter. You can delete a single item or add new Items to the database.</p>
		<h3>The Cons</h3>
		<p>The website isn't overly pretty, it was designed more for form than function, the one major con with this application is it is quite tedious. it takes quite a lot of time to type in the name, brand, location of a product you're adding to StockFinder. your browser will help by remembering previous entries which speeds things up, but I realised the best way to make this as efficient as possible is via the barcodes that are on every product. I can not reasonably use that. I require access to my workplaces stock database and they wouldn't give me that kind of access. the only options is leave it there but be a bit inefficient or to make a web crawler to go through the company's public website to scrape off information like all the barcodes, names of products, brands etc.</p>

		<h2>Blog</h2>
		<img src="images/blog.png">
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/information.svg">This is a blog website I made, originally designed as my portfolio</p>
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/keyboard.jpg">the project is made with CodeIgniter a PHP Framework and MySQL as a database.</p>
		<p><img class="project-icons" src="images/GitHub-Mark.png">you can view the working site <a href="https://william.burntoast.nz/">here</a> or view the source code at <a href="https://github.com/Gnomorian/blog-framework">GitHub</a></p>
		<h3>The Pros</h3>
		<p>I have never been satisfied with my portfolio, I have changed it 4 times already, this was attempt 2. the idea was that the home page contained a description about me, the latest blog posts, which were updates to projects I have made as well as links to how all updates to a specific project. I have all of these features working as well as users have the ability to post comments on a post and I can log into the site too add/remove comments/post/projects.</p>
		<h3>The Cons</h3>
		<p>I realised once I made the blog, I never used it, I'm not a fan of the design I came up with for the blog either, it was not really my style</p>
